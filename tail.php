							Dan McGonigle is a sofware engineer in Southern Mississippi.  He graduated from the University of Southern 
							Mississippi with a 4.0 Grade Point Average, and has worked on programs for the Departments of the Air 
							Force and Navy since 2007.  
							<br><br>
							In 2017, Dan was sent to prison by a military court for a crime he didn't commit.
