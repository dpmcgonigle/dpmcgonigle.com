## About

[LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/lamp-stack-explained) stack website for web design (incomplete).  Makes use of Bootstrap4 CSS, javascript and jQuery.

![Landing Page][img/screenshot.png]

Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, and should be able to run locally on a machine with phpmyadmin or XAMPP, or similar software for creating a local server on your machine.

## Note

Note that the website is incomplete, as my original plan to build websites for businesses conflicted with the lack of time I had available to build said websites.
