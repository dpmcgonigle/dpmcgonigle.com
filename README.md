LAMP stack website for marketing myself.

This website was designed using PHP files as building blocks to create each page, which can be navigated using the menu at the top of the screen.

There is one CSS style sheet and one javascript include, and there are a number of PHP files for connecting to the database on Bluehost and querying data.

Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.
